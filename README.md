# SDM-multispecies-occupancy_model

This tutorial will demonstrate how to run multispecies (single season) occupancy model (Dorazio et al., 2006, https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/0012-9658%282006%2987%5B842%3AESRAAB%5D2.0.CO%3B2). 
Here, I have used 45 mammal species from a large-scale camera trap data but this method can be easily extended to any biodiversity data with spatial and temporal replicates.
This is particularly useful for biodiversity monitoring and if you have data from the same study area across years, you can compare the change in biodiversity.
This tutorial produces species richness map for observed species, you also have an option to extend to include unobserved species using the data augmentation appraoch.

Happy coding!
